# **Quiz Game**
This project is a simple quiz game written in Python.

### **How to play**
To play, simply run the main.py file with Python. The game will present you with a series of questions and ask you to answer with “True” or “False”. At the end of the game, your final score will be displayed.

### **How it works**
The game uses the Question and QuizBrain classes to handle the questions and logic of the game. The Question class defines an individual question with its text and answer. The QuizBrain class manages the list of questions and keeps track of the current question number and the user's score.

The question data is stored in the data module as a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a question with its text and answer.

### **Customisation**
You can customise the game by adding, deleting or modifying questions in the data module. Simply add, delete or modify the dictionaries in the question_data list to change the questions in the game.
